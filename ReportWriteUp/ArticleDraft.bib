	abstract = "<P>Preschoolers count objects most accurately when they gesture as they count. This study tests two possible explanations for this effect. One is that gesture helps children keep track of counted items. Another is that gesture helps children coordinate saying the number words and tagging the items. Twenty pre-schoolers counted chips under three types of conditions: with gesture prohibited, with active gesture, and with a puppet gesturing as children counted aloud. The puppet conditions were intended to distinguish the benefits of keeping track with gesture from the benefits of active gesture. Children counted more accurately when they or the puppet gestured than when gesture was prohibited. However, children's errors differed when they and the puppet gestured. When children gestured themselves, they made errors keeping track, but when the puppet gestured, they made errors coordinating number words and items. Thus, active gesture helps children both to keep track and to coordinate tagging the items and saying the number words. In these ways, active gesture helps children implement their knowledge of one-to-one correspondence.</P>",
